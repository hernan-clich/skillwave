## ´Javascript´

A standard but stylish React app created with create-react-app, it solely uses functional components, which allowed me to use some different hooks here and there.

## `Styling`

I decided to use a 7-1 Sass Architecture, I only created the directories that made sense for this particular project (no need to create an empty vendors folder) with SCSS syntax, which keeps the code pretty modular in my opinion.
